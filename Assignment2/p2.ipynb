    "**Name**: Gabriel Martinez\n",

    "**Course**: WES 237A\n",

    "\n",
    "## 1. Objective\n",
    "The goal of this assignment is to become familiar with Python’s threading library by launching and managing multiple threads and coordinating shared resources using locks to solve the five dining philosophers problem by implementing LED blinking behavior to visualize concurrent thread execution and current state of each theard. Additionally, button interrupts are used to safely terminate running threads, reinforcing proper thread control and synchronization techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Design Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "A top down design methodology was used to structure the implementation. The overall problem was decomposed into smaller, testable components:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. I started off by controlling the four onboard leds and solo tri color led\n",
    "2. Then I utilzed the previous assignment to create a blinking function using the pulse width modulation to control the frequency and duty cycle of the led.\n",
    "3. Then I used one thread to call this function.\n",
    "4. Then I used the threading.Events obbject to control the thread so I can signal a way to stop the threads while loop.\n",
    "5. I then created methods to start, pause, unpause, and stop an led for any thread.\n",
    "6. Then tested that I had full control of an led on a thread.\n",
    "7. Created a dictionary of threads for easy access to a thread.\n",
    "8. I created a button listener that runs on its own thread listening for two things:\n",
    "    - The 4th button to start the assignment\n",
    "    - Any  other button to stop the threads  as requested\n",
    "9. I had the data structures and control of the threads at this point so I created a generic wait function for an led to blink.\n",
    "10.  From that generic wait function i created a nap,eat, and starve function with predefined wait values and blink rate per assignment request.\n",
    "11.  The initial functions all instantiated each thread to run these nap,eat, and starve functions all with the same values on each thread.\n",
    "12. That was fine for the first part of the assignment but I had to modify my thread function to allow random wait values for each action for each thread per assignment part 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "TL;DR. Each component was verified independently and manually tested before integrating into the final workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Workflow and Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "The strategy for this assignment was to create a single worker function that could be easily instantiated and run on its own thread. The worker function, called `blinkLedWithLockControl`, operates by attempting to access an array of shared locks. In this design, each thread represents a philosopher, and the five locks represent the philosophers' left forks.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Part A2.1\n",
    "The workflow begins by checking whether the current thread can acquire its own (left) fork. If successful, it then attempts to acquire the right fork using a non blocking approach. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Starve\n",
    "If either fork is unavailable, any acquired lock is released and a `starve` method is called, which turns the LED off to visually indicate the starving state with a predefined `duration`. This process repeats until the thread is able to acquire both forks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Eat\n",
    "Once both forks are acquired, the `eat` method is executed. This method turns the LED on for a predefined `duration` to visually represent the eating state. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Nap\n",
    "After eating, the locks are released and a `nap` method is called, which blinks the LED at a slower rate to indicate the resting state with a predefined `duration`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This cycle continues until a button interrupt is triggered, which safely terminates the application.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Part A2.2\n",
    "The same workflow was used however I needed to modify the predefinded `duration` values for the starve, eat, and nap methods so that each thread uses a random integer value per assignment ask.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Difficulties and Troubleshooting\n",
    "\n",
    "Several challenges were encountered during development. First challenges was determining how to properly control and terminate a thread. After reviewing the Python threading API, I used the Event object to manage the thread's lifecycle. During early testing, many threads were spawned and continued running in the background, consuming system resources and requiring frequent kernel restarts. Another major challenge involved tuning the timing of the non blocking thread behavior, which initially led to excessive starvation. Adjusting the duration of each philosopher's actions required many iterations to achieve stable and balanced execution. Despite these efforts, no systematic or analytical approach was identified that could guarantee the absence of deadlocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Results and Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "The objectives of this assignment were successfully met. Individual LEDs were controlled by separate threads, demonstrating proper thread creation and independent execution. Non blocking lock based synchronization was used to safely access shared resources and produce the correct LED behavior, providing clear visual feedback of each thread's state. Button interrupts were also implemented to terminate threads as intended, confirming correct thread control and coordination."
